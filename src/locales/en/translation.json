    "paragraph2": "When choosing our cremation furnace, we prioritized two key aspects. First, ensuring it was specifically designed for pets, guaranteeing a gentle and appropriate process. Second, minimizing environmental impact, knowing cremation can be a potentially polluting activity. Thanks to the technology we use, our estimated emissions are below 1%.",
